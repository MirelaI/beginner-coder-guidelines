#Versioning Systems

##GIT
-[gitimmersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) - at most 4 hours, nice and easy tutorial
-[github for begginers](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html) - for better github understanding
-[cloud bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud) - this will give you free private repos


##Other versioning systems:
- SVN, CVS: These are old and pretty limited in terms of functionality

#Data Structures

##BEST BOOK: 
-[Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) it walks you through everything that a programmer must know

##Courses
-[Data structures and optimizing performance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance): Free if you enroll as audit only, should be enough
-[Algorithmic toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/home/welcome):  For algorithms learning
-[Algorithms design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis/home/welcome): a difficult one, but it gives you a taste of what you will encounter at university

#Databases:

There are two big types of databases: Relational and Non-relational (NoSQL)
It is not a must to know all of them, just do one of each
##Relational: 

    E.q: MySQL, postgres, Oracle 
    - [SQL](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
    - [Database management](https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-management/home/welcome)
##NoSQL: 
    - [MongoDB](https://university.mongodb.com/): you can choose a course from the list that suits you 
    - [ElasicSearch](https://www.elastic.co/): You will find it difficult at first, but this is really powerfull and would be usefull to have the basics
    - [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/): If you had an idea about Mongo this is pretty straight forward

---------------

#Programming languages
##Backend: 
    - [PHP]( http://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp): is easy to pick up and you can use it to quickly build web applications
    - [Python]( https://developers.google.com/edu/python/): google/facebook/instagram/twitter all use it and it is a really powerfull programming language
    - [JAVA] ( https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-design-principles#)

    - [Scala]( https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1): functional programming, if you wanna go into big data, learning scala is the best way to do it

##Frontend: 
    - [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/): you find here all you need, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and so on
