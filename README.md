#Versioning Systems

##GIT
http://gitimmersion.com/ - at most 4 hours, nice and easy tutorial
http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html - for better github understanding
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud - this will give you free private repos


Other versioning systems: SVN, CVS - but these are old and pretty limited in terms of functionality

#Data Structures

##BEST BOOK: https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850 - it walks you through everything that a programmer must know

-https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance - Free if you enroll as audit only, should be enough
-https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/home/welcome       - For algorithms learning
-https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis/home/welcome - a difficult one, but it gives you a taste of what you will encounter at university

#Databases:

There are two big types of databases: Relational and Non-relational (NoSQL)
It is not a must to know all of them, just do one of each
##Relational: 

    ###E.q: MySQL, postgres, Oracle 
    - http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
    - https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-management/home/welcome
##NoSQL: 
    --MongoDB: https://university.mongodb.com/ - you can choose a course from the list that suits you 
    --ElasicSearch: https://www.elastic.co/ - You will find it difficult at first, but this is really powerfull and would be usefull to have the basics
    --CouchDB: http://couchdb.apache.org/   - If you had an idea about Mongo this is pretty straight forward

#Programming languages
##Backend: 
    -PHP is easy to pick up and you can use it to quickly build web applications
    http://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp

    -Python: google/facebook/instagram/twitter all use it and it is a really powerfull programming language
    https://developers.google.com/edu/python/

    -JAVA
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-design-principles# 

    -Scala - functional programming, if you wanna go into big data, learning scala is the best way to do it
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1

##Frontend: 
    http://www.w3schools.com/ - you find here all you need, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and so on
